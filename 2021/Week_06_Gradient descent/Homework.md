Consider two functions<br>
$$f_1(x, y) = (x − y)^2 + xy$$
$$f_2(x, y) = (1- (y - 4))^2 + 35((x + 6)-(y - 4)^2)^2$$
(a) Run gradient descent on f1 with starting point (x, y) = (2, 3), T = 20 steps and γ = .05.
Report the function value at the end of each step<br>
(b) Run gradient descent on f2 with starting point (x, y) = (0, 2), T = 100 steps and
γ = .0015. Report the function value at the end of each step<br>
(c) Run any variant of gradient descent you want for f1. Try to get the smallest function
value after T = 20 steps<br>
(d) Run any variant of gradient descent you want for f2. Try to get the smallest function
value after T = 100 steps<br>
