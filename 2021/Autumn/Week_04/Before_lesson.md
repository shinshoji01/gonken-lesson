# Before Lesson for Auto-Encoder

This lesson is conducted at November 17, 2021 by Sho Inoue. Before taking this losson, I would like you to do three things for everyone and one thing for those who have enough time to prepare.

## Download Dataset
I created the modified version of MNIST dataset for this lesson, so please download it and put it in `dataset/MNIST/`. The dataset is located [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FVkhfpMpGe1SZ22HsCfvjSO9WUi7tcBC?usp=sharing).

## Download Parameters
Since I have only limited time to provide a lesson, I trained the VAE in advance. Please download it and put it in `data/parameters/`. The parameters is located [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IQqtZcxBUgh4d6MNKQSyOnGh_TXNOV1S?usp=sharing).

## Run the notebooks in advance.
I don't want to waste our time solving errors, so please run all the notebooks in `notebooks/`.And, since I will use plotly for my lesson, there might be problems running notebooks with JupyterLab. In that case, you can use the normal jupyter notebook, instead. Iijima-san will provide a lesson using plotly at Nov. 11, 2021. Therefore, you can use the same environment.

## (optional) Read the references.
You can read the references in the notebooks, if you have time.
