    "### Statement of purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This course was made to give non-technical knowledge of a sequence of topics we deem necesary for the conceptual understanding of deep neural networks. While some explanations may seem overly simplistic, we chose to focus on understandability over depth. Topics were chosen from the first two chapters of Ian Goodfellow's book [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/), and reorganized to fit the narrative we wished to convey. \n",
    "\n",
    "This series of lessons were made by Inoue Sho and Nakano Lucas for the Gonsalves lab's 2020 April batch of research students.\n",

    "### Intended usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Each section of this course is based on portions of the book, which is available online at https://www.deeplearningbook.org/. These chapters are listed in the beginning of each lesson, and we strongly recommend reading them if you wish to deeply learn the topics we present. \n",
    "\n",
    "This course is superficial by necessity, and many portions of the lessons are supplemented by [external links](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/e/external_link.htm). We suggest visiting these whenever a topic puzzles you or if something sparks your interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "Made as a series of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), this course is intended to be interactive. We encourage you to modify the code presented here and play with them until you understand their specific function. Be sure to make use of [Jupyter's question mark notation](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/01.01-help-and-documentation.html). Take this as an opportunity to both learn about not only machine learning, but also Python coding!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find yourself missing any libraries necessary for a lesson, you can install them right in the notebook using pip (e.g. \"pip install jupyterlab\"). Before going any further, we recommend installing the following libraries:\n",
    "- pandas\n",
    "- scipy\n",
    "- seaborn\n",
    "- sklearn\n",
    "Optional, but recommended:\n",
    "- jupyterlab\n",
